# ReactJS 10 Mini Projects

> **Repository:** Manojkhanavalkar / ReactJS-10-Mini-Projects
>
> A curated collection of small React projects built to practice core React concepts — components, props, state, hooks, context, routing, local storage and styling with Tailwind/CSS. Each project lives in its own folder so you can run them independently.

## 🚀 Quick overview

This repo contains the following mini-projects (folder names preserved):

1. `01basicreact` — A minimal/basic React app (starter project).
2. `01basicvite` — Starter app using Vite.
3. `02counter` — Simple counter demonstrating state and event handling.
4. `03tailwindprops` — Examples of Tailwind utility usage & passing props to components.
5. `04bgChanger` — Background/theme/color changer demonstrating DOM/styles update.

9. `08minicontext` — Demo of React Context for state sharing across components.
10. `09themeswitcher` — Theme switcher (light/dark) using state and local storage.

## 📌 What recruiters should notice

* **Hands‑on with core React features:** components, props, state, event handling.
* **Modern toolchain experience:** Vite starter included.
* **State management practice:** Context API and local storage in the todo app.
* **Routing:** Small multi‑page demo using React Router.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS examples and CSS-based projects.
* **Small, focused projects:** each folder focuses on one concept — ideal for interview demos.

## 🧾 How to run any project (general instructions)

Most projects follow the same pattern. From the repository root, open a terminal and run:

```bash
# pick a project folder, for example:
cd 02counter

# install
npm install

# start the dev server (try either of these, depending on the project):
npm run dev        # for Vite-based projects
# or
npm start          # for CRA-style projects
```

If `npm run dev` fails, try `npm start`. If there is no `package.json` inside a folder, open the folder to inspect how the project is structured (some folders may be plain HTML/CSS/JS demos).

screenshots/02counter.png
screenshots/05passwordgenerator.png
...etc
```

Then make sure the screenshot links in this README point to those files.
